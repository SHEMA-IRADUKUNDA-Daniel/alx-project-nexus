            Cord-cutting is becoming a huge thing these days. People around the
            world are tired of paying the massive bills associated with cable TV
            and the subscriptions of Netflix and other streaming platforms. The
            good news is that sites like Movie App are making cord-cutting
            possible. They offer free movies and TV shows for all people around
            the world. But as you can imagine, things have not been smooth.
            Movie App and others like it have been targeted by relevant
            authorities for piracy and copyright infringement. But nonetheless,
            they still offer a great streaming option.
